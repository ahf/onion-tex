Onion Theme for Beamer
======================

Onion is a modern and simple theme for LaTeX's Beamer document class inspired
by [The Tor Project](https://www.torproject.org/)'s new and fancy
[styleguide](https://styleguide.torproject.org/).

## Open Questions

This section contains a couple of open questions that I have yet to figure out
what to do about.

- Should we use justified text in slides?

  A lot of people rightfully argue that if you need text justification in
  slides it usually means that you have too much text, but at the same time if
  you need to have a lot of text the current line wrapping makes it look like an
  HTML site.
